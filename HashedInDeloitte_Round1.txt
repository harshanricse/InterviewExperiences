1. Given an array nums containing n distinct numbers in the range [0,n], return the only number in the range that is missing from the array.
Example1:
input: nums = [3,0,1]
output: 2
Explanation:
n = 3 since there are 3 numbers, so all numbers are in the range [0,3]. 2 is the missing number in the range since it does not appear in nums.

Input: nums = [9,6,4,2,3,5,7,0,1]
output: 8
Explanation:
n = 9 since there are 9 numbers, so all numbers are in the range [0,9]. 8 is the missing number in the range since it does not appear in nums.

Output: 1

Example 2:
Input: nums = [4,1,2,1,2]
Output: 4

Example 3:
Input: nums = [1]
Output: 1
